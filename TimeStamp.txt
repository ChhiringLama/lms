    1, Making reducer store persist
    2, Removing store 
    3, Adding Admin pages
    4, Adding other routes in Layout.jsx
    5, Routing
     In Sidebar.jsx notice how we used <Outlet> -> to understand whats happening here look at app.js, 
     we have a path called /admin , which has children routes /course and /dashboared. 
     both routes are made available in sidebar.jsx
    
     now when "course" is hit we send <courseTable>, when "dashboard" is hit we send <dashboard>,
     Outlet is the one responble to render the received component
